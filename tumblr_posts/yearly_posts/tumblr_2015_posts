/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Nov 2, 2015.txt:You never expect the woman of your dreams to step into reality. ;They simply serve as an image of that which seems impossible, unattainable. ;And when that day comes, that day when the woman of your dreams steps into reality, you continue to believe you're dreaming, because something so beautiful, so bright, so...good, could never stand in front of you. ;And then when they stand in front of you the initial thought that comes to mind is,;"why?", followed by,;"how?" ;And so you look back, perplexed, searching for that person she might be looking for, and then you're struck by more confusion after you realize she is looking for you. ;And so you hug her and smile and smile and smile because you're happy, because she makes you happy. ;Because us makes me happy. ;Because you make me happy.
/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Oct 10, 2015.txt:It's rough being a romantic in this day and age. ;An era of courtship and romanticism has been forgotten and replaced by nuanced ideals and the notion of what some refer to as;"hook-up culture." ;This is not to say that casual sex or drunkenly making out with someone at a bar is something to be condemned. ;Everyone is intrinsically allowed to do with their body what they please.>The truth is today it is easier to go out, meet someone you are moderately attracted to for whatever reason, and say;"just for tonight, let's do this." ;This idea could serve many purposes, all which can be compiled into one word: cathartic. ;It seems that the average college student desires so desperately to relieve them-self from all stress, anxiety, pain, and fear, that they turn to drugs, alcohol, and now,;"hooking up." ;>The phrase;"hooking up" is also subjective, I'm not too sure if I know what it means. Some have claimed hooking up equates to making out. ;Others have referred to it as the action of coitus. ;Who knows. ;The only thing I do know is that, to some, it means a no strings attached, one night, hit it then quit, kind of ordeal. ;No one in college can/wants to be in a relationship, right? ;It is encumbering and stressful and they are simply too many other beautiful students that being tethered to one would be foolish. ;>It is this notion that are killing the romantics, those whom believe in passion over flirtation. ;Where did all my fellow romantics go by the way? ;I fear they are giving up on passion and/or turning to a life of flirtation. ;It is understandable how it can be easier to hide then be openly romantic. ;Why risk being called a fool and being told that you are wasting four great years by being in a relationship. ;>I'm hear to say all that is bullshit. ;Fuck what misguided people are saying. ;They may argue there are too many people to be with one. ;I argue they are so many people, find that one. ;If you love someone you hold on to them. ;>Others will put thoughts in your mind and doubts will arise, but it's important to take a step back and always analyse what is going on. ;See a counselor. ;Please see a counselor if you have any concerns and/or are having negative feelings. ;This is the first step to lessening the number of regrets in life. ;And to say;"live life without regrets" is also bullshit. ;It's important to minimize those regrets, however. ;Minimize your doubts while you're at it. ;>To those romantics who've found each other early on. ;Stay strong, because there is most likely a rough and bumpy road ahead of you. ;In addition to what I said earlier, if you love someone, you hold on to them until you can't anymore. ;Fight for what you have built. ;Love until you can't anymore. ;>And so to all my fellow college romantics, please stop hiding and please hear my typed words. ;In the words of Mitch Albom, "accept who you are; and revel in it." ;I know I wish someone had given me this advice ahead of time. ;

/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Sep 6, 2015.txt:It's concerning how emotional I have been these last few days.; It's evident through my bitch ass poems.; Most of it might be from the internal strife with Aleysha, I've been remembering Abuela a lot lately too and I'm not sure why.; I think my biggest issue right now is that I have no one I trust to release this shit to.; My go-to was Aleysha.; Yeah I have friends whom I'm much closer to than ever before, but I still don't trust them with my shit.; Aleysha got upset that I haven't called the counselors, but I honestly just forget because I'm busy during the day and when I get a chance later in the day, the office is closed.; I miss her presence.; I miss my rock.
