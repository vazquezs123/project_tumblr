/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Aug 23, 2012.txt:I cant sleep.  I become more terrified with every single passing second. Your inevitable departure leaves me frightened, not knowing what is yet to come.  My strength will be assessed, which is unfair due to the fact that I can barely lift my own stability, let alone the weight of this relationship.  At times I regret allowing myself to have fallen so deeply in love with you. My love is very much like a rock falling from the sky.  It plummets to the ground quickly, unchanging and only gaining momentum (ignoring air resistance).  It will ultimately endure a collision with the ground, but what really matters is what happens to the rock. Does it shatter into a million other new rocks? Does it simply collide and remain on the ground never to be moved again? Or maybe, just maybe, it has the ability to penetrate the ground overcoming Earth and its properties, defying not only the laws of physics, but the laws embezzled in my brain which state that there just isn't anymore momentum.  I'm losing a part of me for four days a week.  I will be lost for four days every week.  I will be upset for four days a week.  I will be sad for four days a week. I will potentially continue to make poor judgements for four days within the next ten months.  Somebody help me please.

This is just one of many examples.  I don't know if its me being selfish, but this happens often, and its disappointing/upsetting.  Just so you know, its the things you do that are disappointing.  Its also my fault for getting worked up and excited for something so little.  I suppose I'll just head out by myself and find things...

Little do you know Im writing about you.  Your voice is like a foot massage in my ears.  I haven't heard you sing a full length song, but I know your voice is like fergie and jesus combined from the pieces of songs you do you sing or hum.   Your eyes are closed and my lips want to forever remain pressed against your lips.  My first tumblr post without my virginity.  I gave you my v-card.  I gave you that shit.  It's yours forever now, and there's no one else I would want to have but you.   I was nervous at first, but you calmed ny nerves when you spoke.  Your un-normality made everything better, and I'm grateful for that.  I didn't find it weird, nor did I feel weird after.  Everything felt right and that's exactly how I've imagined it.  Right.  It shouldn't be weird.  At least one not to me.  Im comfortable with you.  Im also grateful you didn't laugh at my penis.  You didn't notice, but I had the condom the wrong way when I was first putting it on.  Gosh I was so fucking horny. I still kind of am, but what seventeen year old boy isn't.

My father would do it for me, therefore I must do it for him. I've been disappointing people lately, at least that's how I feel. I try so incredibly hard to please people, and its so difficult. I become so frustrated that people can't just accept me and my effort. I guess this is why I feel so lonely. Im sorry Aleysha. I wish I was this perfect guy. I wish I could provide her with everything she wants and more. I wish I never upset her and didn't make her worry. I'm not perfect, and can't do all the things she wants. Im sorry. We've been fighting a lot lately and I hate it. I feel myself pulling apart and its because I dont like to deal with this. I think I get upset easily and have issues beyond measure. I also don't know if you do things to piss me off purposely, which I honestly don't believe you do. It just feels that way sometimes.  I just think that since I literally put you before anything that I expect the same in return.  Its wrong of me to do that.

Im coming.". You'd run to the car, I'd hug you for what isn't long enough, but seems like forever. We'd talk and I'll cry about how much I've missed and how much I love you.  I'd want to lay in your bosom.  In reality, you said okay, and I went home.  Truth is, I've been feeling weird these past few days.  Many things on my mind.  Not enough time in the world.  I was so excited earlier to see your face.  I so desperately wanted to see your face.  I so desperately wanted to touch your face.  I so desperately wanted to kiss your face....I don't know if i want to right now....
