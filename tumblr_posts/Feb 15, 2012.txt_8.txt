Im sorry about that.  This is what I was afraid of.  I just wish I&rsquo;ve known from the start.  Could&rsquo;ve saved me a lot of sleepless nights.  All the stress would have vanished.  It really sucks.  I don&rsquo;t feel like talking to anyone, nor doing anything.  I wish I was good at taking these standardized tests.  I wish I had taken programs during the summer that would&rsquo;ve helped me.  I didn&rsquo;t.  I haven&rsquo;t been this disappointed in myself since that little league playoff game I lost.  Im sorry for wasting your time office of admissions at NYU.</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/17687382749/guess-im-not-good-enough-im-sorry-about-that"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Feb 15, 2012</span></div>
