I understand different people grieve in different ways, but I feel that abuela would be so disappointed right now.  You know why? Because she lived to please us.  She lived to see us happy, And would fly to the moon if it meant just that. She would make bacon on the side because you didn&rsquo;t like what everyone else was eating.  She would make you avena at 5 o'clock in the afternoon because you love it so much.  She would buy cases of yoohoo because to her, you didnt drink anything else. She would immediately bounve back up after I almost ran her over because she thought I was worried.  She would go up to conneticut and cook for you because you wanted her to and she wanted to.  She would pick up the kids from school, even when she shouldnt have been driving.  She would get on your nerves because she had nothing better to do, but she wouldve been nothing without you.  Abuela would have been nothing without us, because we were her life.  And as it seems that we are nothing without her, we have the potential to be twice the person we are now.  We are able to reflect and learn  and practice how to care as unconditionally for their family as abuela did.  So the way I see it, there&rsquo;s no need to fret.  We would just disappoint abuela.</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/71100877817/i-think-that-we-should-all-stop-feeling-sorry-for"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Dec 25, 2013</span></div>
