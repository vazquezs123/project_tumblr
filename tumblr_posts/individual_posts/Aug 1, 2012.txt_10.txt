I guess this will have to wait.  I dont want to be selfish anymore.  It sucks that I have to cancel, but there&rsquo;ll be plenty of more times.  I love being with you anyway. I just hope I&rsquo;m not all &ldquo; fuck this shit&rdquo; tomorrow.  It was blow to hear that I couldn&rsquo;t see you on Friday.  You told me you weren&rsquo;t doing anything and that you might take off.  I was really excited.  Womp womp womp. I was going to take you to batting cages.
