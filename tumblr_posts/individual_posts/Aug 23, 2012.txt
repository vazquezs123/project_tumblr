I become more terrified with every single passing second. Your inevitable departure leaves me frightened, not knowing what is yet to come.  My strength will be assessed, which is unfair due to the fact that I can barely lift my own stability, let alone the weight of this relationship.  At times I regret allowing myself to have fallen so deeply in love with you. My love is very much like a rock falling from the sky.  It plummets to the ground quickly, unchanging and only gaining momentum (ignoring air resistance).  It will ultimately endure a collision with the ground, but what really matters is what happens to the rock. Does it shatter into a million other new rocks? Does it simply collide and remain on the ground never to be moved again? Or maybe, just maybe, it has the ability to penetrate the ground overcoming Earth and its properties, defying not only the laws of physics, but the laws embezzled in my brain which state that there just isn&rsquo;t anymore momentum.  I&rsquo;m losing a part of me for four days a week.  I will be lost for four days every week.  I will be upset for four days a week.  I will be sad for four days a week. I will potentially continue to make poor judgements for four days within the next ten months.  Somebody help me please.</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/30025628348/i-cant-sleep-i-become-more-terrified-with-every"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Aug 23, 2012</span></div>
