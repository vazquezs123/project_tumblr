If I had to select a word to describe my current state, it would probably be unstable.&nbsp; But only on the inside.&nbsp; It is cathartic to write out all these thoughts though.&nbsp; 9.6.2015<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Working on this&hellip;<br /></p><p>If I were to leave this Earth,</p><p>Will you remember me always? <br /></p><p>I know you&rsquo;ve been busy lately,</p><p>Just please don&rsquo;t forget all the mornings.</p><p><br /></p><p>Waking up by my side,</p><p>Face pressed upon a pillow,</p><p>your left eye creeps open.</p><p>The curtains remain shut, yet your smile illuminates the room.</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/128508892432/its-concerning-how-emotional-i-have-been-these"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Sep 6, 2015</span></div>
