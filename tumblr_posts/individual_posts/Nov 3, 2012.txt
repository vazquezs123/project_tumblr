I&rsquo;ve been feeling weird and the last thing i want to do is wait on this never ending line to get gas. My father would do it for me, therefore I must do it for him. I&rsquo;ve been disappointing people lately, at least that&rsquo;s how I feel. I try so incredibly hard to please people, and its so difficult. I become so frustrated that people can&rsquo;t just accept me and my effort. I guess this is why I feel so lonely. Im sorry Aleysha. I wish I was this perfect guy. I wish I could provide her with everything she wants and more. I wish I never upset her and didn&rsquo;t make her worry. I&rsquo;m not perfect, and can&rsquo;t do all the things she wants. Im sorry. We&rsquo;ve been fighting a lot lately and I hate it. I feel myself pulling apart and its because I dont like to deal with this. I think I get upset easily and have issues beyond measure. I also don&rsquo;t know if you do things to piss me off purposely, which I honestly don&rsquo;t believe you do. It just feels that way sometimes.  I just think that since I literally put you before anything that I expect the same in return.  Its wrong of me to do that.</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/34880011992/fuck-this-shit-ive-been-feeling-weird-and-the"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Nov 3, 2012</span></div>
