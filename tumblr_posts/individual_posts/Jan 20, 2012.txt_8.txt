My eagerness has overcome me.  You lay on my stomach and a thousand doves above the Carribean beaches as the sun sets could not compare to how beautiful you are.  You&rsquo;re looking at me.  &ldquo;you&rsquo;re writing a novel&rdquo; is what you said.  Little do you know Im writing about you.  Your voice is like a foot massage in my ears.  I haven&rsquo;t heard you sing a full length song, but I know your voice is like fergie and jesus combined from the pieces of songs you do you sing or hum.   Your eyes are closed and my lips want to forever remain pressed against your lips.  My first tumblr post without my virginity.  I gave you my v-card.  I gave you that shit.  It&rsquo;s yours forever now, and there&rsquo;s no one else I would want to have but you.   I was nervous at first, but you calmed ny nerves when you spoke.  Your un-normality made everything better, and I&rsquo;m grateful for that.  I didn&rsquo;t find it weird, nor did I feel weird after.  Everything felt right and that&rsquo;s exactly how I&rsquo;ve imagined it.  Right.  It shouldn&rsquo;t be weird.  At least one not to me.  Im comfortable with you.  Im also grateful you didn&rsquo;t laugh at my penis.  You didn&rsquo;t notice, but I had the condom the wrong way when I was first putting it on.  Gosh I was so fucking horny. I still kind of am, but what seventeen year old boy isn&rsquo;t.  Im gonna go cuz your suspecting things&hellip;.maybe i&rsquo;ll come back later&hellip;maybe not&hellip;</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/16199246459/i-was-going-to-wait-to-write-this-post-my"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Jan 20, 2012</span></div>
