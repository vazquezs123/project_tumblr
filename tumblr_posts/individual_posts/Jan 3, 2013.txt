It&rsquo;s frustrating. Im trying incredibly hard. As soon as I&rsquo;m about to give in, I succumb to my love. I do not want to put up with this anymore though. I froze my nuts off, so what if you were going to get in trouble. I would&rsquo;ve taken the blame. As you would say, I guess I dont understand, but I needed you. I&rsquo;ve needed you for the past three days. You weren&rsquo;t there. I thought going with Eddie would help me get my mind off you, but you&rsquo;re all I could think about. I give you your space. That&rsquo;s fine. I know you probably dont think so, and most times I dont believe so, but I think you take me for granted. I would do anything for you. You were jerky today and it bothered me. You seemed upset today, Im sorry. I wanted to speak with you, and not on the phone. I know you probably really want to see Maria and Kim and thats koo. It saddened me a little, but its koo. Im really angry inside, Im not sure but I think for the first time ever I don&rsquo;t want to see you. Im worried.</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/39542400128/aleysha-and-i-have-been-arguing-a-lot-more-than"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Jan 3, 2013</span></div>
