One is when my plans get messed up.  I have no one to blame but myself.  I persist in ditching my plans for you, even if it means maybe being with you.  Im so obsessed with being with you I single handedly sabotage my own plans.  Me not being with you is killing me inside.  Im torn between playing or not.  I would have practice everyday, and me not seeing you will continue.  That&rsquo;s unfair to you though&hellip;.I fucking hate myself&hellip;.the other thing I hate is when I have this idea of something&hellip;but its the complete opposite. Yes ill drop my plans to give you kiss&hellip;.the fuck are your friends doing here?</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/19015177996/i-dont-hate-many-things-but-there-are-two-things"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Mar 9, 2012</span></div>
