Each time I&#039;ve experienced different emotions, ranging from confused to sad to anger.  I understand that I placed this uncertainty and doubt inside of you.  I regret my actions, deeply.  I wish I could turn back the clock and ensure stablity and love with this new assurance.  I wish I had seen a counselor earlier.  Now it&#039;s not about what I could&#039;ve done, it&#039;s about what I&#039;m going to do moving forward.  I have faith that we&#039;ll be together.  Even when I broke up with you, I said I needed to be alone for a while, and because I didn&#039;t communicate we had very different ideas.  I never thought I was letting you go.  You may have thought so because I suck at communicating and when you mentioned us breaking up I never said anything to refute it.  In my mind it didn&#039;t mean anything different from  just space.  I may have become complacent and too comfortable with where we were at that my love for you failed to shine.  For that I&#039;m sorry.  You only lifted me up.  I honestly owe you so much for the place I&#039;m at in life.  You only know compassion and charisma.  You&#039;re beautiful and bright.  You&#039;re perfect.  And it may sound Cliche but you really are.  At this point I only want to love you.  I feel so many emotions right now it&#039;s insane.  I also know that I want to be with you forever.  The counselor has given me so much insight it&#039;s incredibe.  We found out that my insecurities and doubt may be related to my desire to protect and care for my family because I feel forever indebted to my parents and put everyone else before myself.  I had this irrational thought that I had to pick between love and success, maybe that comes from stupid television.  But now I see there&#039;s room for both, and that as long as I&#039;m with you I&#039;d be fine.  And it sucks because I want to tell you all this but I cant.  I wanted to tell you that my research got accepted to be presented at a conference at MIT.  I wanted to thank you again because you pushed me and believed in me.  I&#039;m so disheartened right now, but I&#039;m also okay.  It&#039;s different from the sadness I was feeling a week ago.  I still miss you desperately.  I was so close to begging you for another chance.  But I have hope and faith in us, and I think I mentioned that already above.  In your message to me you said we were trying so hard for something that doesn&#039;t work,  but I have trouble believing that.  It also upsets me because I&#039;ve led you to believe that.  Also running into you at best deli was horrible.  My heart started racing and I had trouble breathing. My anxiety was off the chain.  It&#039;s also funny because I was talking to Ray about our situation, and he thought it was a good idea to go up to you.  I told him I needed to respect your space.  I should&#039;ve followed my gut.  I hope that to didn&#039;t make things worse.  The last thing I want you to feel when you think of me is resentment.   So now I&#039;ll wait and hope you&#039;re remotely as in love with me as I still am with you.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/129428444877/9192015"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Sep 19, 2015</span></div>
