Im coming.&rdquo;. You&rsquo;d run to the car, I&rsquo;d hug you for what isn&rsquo;t long enough, but seems like forever. We&rsquo;d talk and I&rsquo;ll cry about how much I&rsquo;ve missed and how much I love you.  I&rsquo;d want to lay in your bosom.  In reality, you said okay, and I went home.  Truth is, I&rsquo;ve been feeling weird these past few days.  Many things on my mind.  Not enough time in the world.  I was so excited earlier to see your face.  I so desperately wanted to see your face.  I so desperately wanted to touch your face.  I so desperately wanted to kiss your face&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t know if i want to right now&hellip;.</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/31960387445/i-drove-theiri-waitedi-know-you-wanted-to"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Sep 20, 2012</span></div>
