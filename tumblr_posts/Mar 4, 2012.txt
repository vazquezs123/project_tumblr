Dying? &nbsp;Punching a whole in my wall would accomplish nothing, but it sure as hell would make me feel much better. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry Ma, fuck White Castle. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t know the meaning of commitment or loyalty. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry my baseball career didn&rsquo;t work out. &nbsp;I tried really hard, I did. &nbsp;These other kids have all these resources though, I had a wall to play catch with myself, and batting tee, to level out my swing. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t get into NYU. &nbsp;I know I can still make you guys proud, it&rsquo;s too late for me. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry Padrino. &nbsp;Fuck those job. &nbsp;Fuck that place. &nbsp;You, besides my mom, are one of the hardest workers I know. &nbsp;You adapt to any&nbsp;environment and make it your own. &nbsp;The only reason I could think for them to lay you off is that their afraid you&rsquo;re going to take their jobs from them, so they took yours away first. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry Roger. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry Ti. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry Tio. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry Aleysha. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t be the best boyfriend all the time. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s become difficult to run to you. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve become a jerk. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry I seem to hate everything now. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s hard to a put a smile on my face, and in turn put a smile on yours. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry Pa, for everything. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry world. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t be the person you expect me to be. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t accomplish everything I want and believe in. &nbsp;As much as I tried not to, I&rsquo;m sorry I've&nbsp;succumbed to giving up. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s hard giving up. &nbsp;I barely remember myself giving up anything. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry.</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/18771703394/life-isnt-fair-not-to-my-family-at-least"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Mar 4, 2012</span></div>
