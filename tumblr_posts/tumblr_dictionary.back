Your inevitable departure leaves me frightened, not knowing what is yet to come.  My strength will be assessed, which is unfair due to the fact that I can barely lift my own stability, let alone the weight of this relationship.  At times I regret allowing myself to have fallen so deeply in love with you. My love is very much like a rock falling from the sky.  It plummets to the ground quickly, unchanging and only gaining momentum (ignoring air resistance).  It will ultimately endure a collision with the ground, but what really matters is what happens to the rock. Does it shatter into a million other new rocks? Does it simply collide and remain on the ground never to be moved again? Or maybe, just maybe, it has the ability to penetrate the ground overcoming Earth and its properties, defying not only the laws of physics, but the laws embezzled in my brain which state that there just isn't anymore momentum.  I'm losing a part of me for four days a week.  I will be lost for four days every week.  I will be upset for four days a week.  I will be sad for four days a week. I will potentially continue to make poor judgements for four days within the next ten months.  Somebody help me please.

/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Dec 25, 2013.txt:I think that we should all stop feeling sorry for ourselves.  I understand different people grieve in different ways, but I feel that abuela would be so disappointed right now.  You know why? Because she lived to please us.  She lived to see us happy, And would fly to the moon if it meant just that. She would make bacon on the side because you didn't like what everyone else was eating.  She would make you avena at 5 o'clock in the afternoon because you love it so much.  She would buy cases of yoohoo because to her, you didnt drink anything else. She would immediately bounve back up after I almost ran her over because she thought I was worried.  She would go up to conneticut and cook for you because you wanted her to and she wanted to.  She would pick up the kids from school, even when she shouldnt have been driving.  She would get on your nerves because she had nothing better to do, but she wouldve been nothing without you.  Abuela would have been nothing without us, because we were her life.  And as it seems that we are nothing without her, we have the potential to be twice the person we are now.  We are able to reflect and learn  and practice how to care as unconditionally for their family as abuela did.  So the way I see it, there's no need to fret.  We would just disappoint abuela.

/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Jan 3, 2013.txt:Aleysha and I have been arguing a lot more than usual lately. It's frustrating. Im trying incredibly hard. As soon as I'm about to give in, I succumb to my love. I do not want to put up with this anymore though. I froze my nuts off, so what if you were going to get in trouble. I would've taken the blame. As you would say, I guess I dont understand, but I needed you. I've needed you for the past three days. You weren't there. I thought going with Eddie would help me get my mind off you, but you're all I could think about. I give you your space. That's fine. I know you probably dont think so, and most times I dont believe so, but I think you take me for granted. I would do anything for you. You were jerky today and it bothered me. You seemed upset today, Im sorry. I wanted to speak with you, and not on the phone. I know you probably really want to see Maria and Kim and thats koo. It saddened me a little, but its koo. Im really angry inside, Im not sure but I think for the first time ever I don't want to see you. Im worried.

My father would do it for me, therefore I must do it for him. I've been disappointing people lately, at least that's how I feel. I try so incredibly hard to please people, and its so difficult. I become so frustrated that people can't just accept me and my effort. I guess this is why I feel so lonely. Im sorry Aleysha. I wish I was this perfect guy. I wish I could provide her with everything she wants and more. I wish I never upset her and didn't make her worry. I'm not perfect, and can't do all the things she wants. Im sorry. We've been fighting a lot lately and I hate it. I feel myself pulling apart and its because I dont like to deal with this. I think I get upset easily and have issues beyond measure. I also don't know if you do things to piss me off purposely, which I honestly don't believe you do. It just feels that way sometimes.  I just think that since I literally put you before anything that I expect the same in return.  Its wrong of me to do that.

/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Oct 10, 2015.txt:It's rough being a romantic in this day and age. ;An era of courtship and romanticism has been forgotten and replaced by nuanced ideals and the notion of what some refer to as;"hook-up culture." ;This is not to say that casual sex or drunkenly making out with someone at a bar is something to be condemned. ;Everyone is intrinsically allowed to do with their body what they please.>The truth is today it is easier to go out, meet someone you are moderately attracted to for whatever reason, and say;"just for tonight, let's do this." ;This idea could serve many purposes, all which can be compiled into one word: cathartic. ;It seems that the average college student desires so desperately to relieve them-self from all stress, anxiety, pain, and fear, that they turn to drugs, alcohol, and now,;"hooking up." ;>The phrase;"hooking up" is also subjective, I'm not too sure if I know what it means. Some have claimed hooking up equates to making out. ;Others have referred to it as the action of coitus. ;Who knows. ;The only thing I do know is that, to some, it means a no strings attached, one night, hit it then quit, kind of ordeal. ;No one in college can/wants to be in a relationship, right? ;It is encumbering and stressful and they are simply too many other beautiful students that being tethered to one would be foolish. ;>It is this notion that are killing the romantics, those whom believe in passion over flirtation. ;Where did all my fellow romantics go by the way? ;I fear they are giving up on passion and/or turning to a life of flirtation. ;It is understandable how it can be easier to hide then be openly romantic. ;Why risk being called a fool and being told that you are wasting four great years by being in a relationship. ;>I'm hear to say all that is bullshit. ;Fuck what misguided people are saying. ;They may argue there are too many people to be with one. ;I argue they are so many people, find that one. ;If you love someone you hold on to them. ;>Others will put thoughts in your mind and doubts will arise, but it's important to take a step back and always analyse what is going on. ;See a counselor. ;Please see a counselor if you have any concerns and/or are having negative feelings. ;This is the first step to lessening the number of regrets in life. ;And to say;"live life without regrets" is also bullshit. ;It's important to minimize those regrets, however. ;Minimize your doubts while you're at it. ;>To those romantics who've found each other early on. ;Stay strong, because there is most likely a rough and bumpy road ahead of you. ;In addition to what I said earlier, if you love someone, you hold on to them until you can't anymore. ;Fight for what you have built. ;Love until you can't anymore. ;>And so to all my fellow college romantics, please stop hiding and please hear my typed words. ;In the words of Mitch Albom, "accept who you are; and revel in it." ;I know I wish someone had given me this advice ahead of time. ;

/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Sep 17, 2015.txt_6.txt:I'm pathetic. ;I probably seemed so desperate. ;I felt desperate. ;At the moment I would've given anything for her to just hug me and say it's going to be okay. ;My biggest fear is that it won't be. ;The woman of my dreams, the woman of my future, pulled away. ;If I made her feel ever a tenth of how I'm feeling right now, I might be the worse person ever. ;I was ready to love her as much as I could, and now that amounts to nothing. ;I just want to get over this already. ;This semester is going to be long as fuck, I didn't even get to tell her about MIT. ;My rock is missing.

Im coming.". You'd run to the car, I'd hug you for what isn't long enough, but seems like forever. We'd talk and I'll cry about how much I've missed and how much I love you.  I'd want to lay in your bosom.  In reality, you said okay, and I went home.  Truth is, I've been feeling weird these past few days.  Many things on my mind.  Not enough time in the world.  I was so excited earlier to see your face.  I so desperately wanted to see your face.  I so desperately wanted to touch your face.  I so desperately wanted to kiss your face....I don't know if i want to right now....

/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Sep 27, 2015.txt:I dreamt last night that I got home and Aleysha was waiting for me. ;It hurt when I woke up. ;I'm not sure what I'm doing. ;I keep thinking, "Is there anything I can do?" ;I want to show her so badly it's different this time. ;I feel so different this time. ;I know I hurt her, and I wish I could right my wrong. ;I wish I could promise her I'll never let her go, and she'll believe me. ;I wish I could convince her friends that I'm not a bad guy, I won't hurt her again, and that they can trust me. ;I also wish I didn't seem so crazy right now. ;And though I'm still frustrated at her for giving me hope, I don't blame her and I forgive her. ;But, once again, I don't know what I'm doing. ;I'm close to giving up, but I'm still dreaming with my eyes open. ;

/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Sep 6, 2015.txt:It's concerning how emotional I have been these last few days.; It's evident through my bitch ass poems.; Most of it might be from the internal strife with Aleysha, I've been remembering Abuela a lot lately too and I'm not sure why.; I think my biggest issue right now is that I have no one I trust to release this shit to.; My go-to was Aleysha.; Yeah I have friends whom I'm much closer to than ever before, but I still don't trust them with my shit.; Aleysha got upset that I haven't called the counselors, but I honestly just forget because I'm busy during the day and when I get a chance later in the day, the office is closed.; I miss her presence.; I miss my rock.
