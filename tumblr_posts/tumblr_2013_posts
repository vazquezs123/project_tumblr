/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Apr 20, 2013.txt:Is this what I've come to. ;Staying home, in bed by 11:30 on Saturday nights? ;I work too hard during the week to not enjoy my weekends. ;They might as well be part of the week. ;I'm glad I got to see my brother perform today, but with getting ready and the play, it easily takes up five hours of my day. ;Now what? ;I'm stuck at home, doing nothing I want to do. ;I'll probably do some work, when I'd rather be out having a good time. ;I don't want to go to a movie though, or bowl. ;I mean I always want to bowl, but I want more than this. ;Am I being selfish? ;I love being with Aleysha, don't get me wrong, but I miss out on a lot of things I want, because I put her wants first. ;I have issues saying no. ;Sometimes I think I need space. ;I'm afraid if get space, I'll detach. ;I have issues. ;Lately, I've found it difficult to be happy. ;I pretty much blame school, but I think the bottom line is that I've become boring. ;I don't want to be boring. ;Everyone is out having a good time, and I'm home complaining. ;Damn.

/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Aug 13, 2013.txt_0.txt:This seems to be happening often.; I feel like I can't turn Aleysha on anymore.; If its not that, she turns me off.; When she gets upset or warns me she's gonna get upset, or when she laughs when I'm serious.; Why can't it be like it used to be.; Aleysha was always horny. I'm always horny.; She would become drenched, and I was proud.; I don't know what to think anymore.

/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Dec 25, 2013.txt:I think that we should all stop feeling sorry for ourselves.  I understand different people grieve in different ways, but I feel that abuela would be so disappointed right now.  You know why? Because she lived to please us.  She lived to see us happy, And would fly to the moon if it meant just that. She would make bacon on the side because you didn't like what everyone else was eating.  She would make you avena at 5 o'clock in the afternoon because you love it so much.  She would buy cases of yoohoo because to her, you didnt drink anything else. She would immediately bounve back up after I almost ran her over because she thought I was worried.  She would go up to conneticut and cook for you because you wanted her to and she wanted to.  She would pick up the kids from school, even when she shouldnt have been driving.  She would get on your nerves because she had nothing better to do, but she wouldve been nothing without you.  Abuela would have been nothing without us, because we were her life.  And as it seems that we are nothing without her, we have the potential to be twice the person we are now.  We are able to reflect and learn  and practice how to care as unconditionally for their family as abuela did.  So the way I see it, there's no need to fret.  We would just disappoint abuela.

/home/svaquez/tumblr_posts/individual_posts/Jan 3, 2013.txt:Aleysha and I have been arguing a lot more than usual lately. It's frustrating. Im trying incredibly hard. As soon as I'm about to give in, I succumb to my love. I do not want to put up with this anymore though. I froze my nuts off, so what if you were going to get in trouble. I would've taken the blame. As you would say, I guess I dont understand, but I needed you. I've needed you for the past three days. You weren't there. I thought going with Eddie would help me get my mind off you, but you're all I could think about. I give you your space. That's fine. I know you probably dont think so, and most times I dont believe so, but I think you take me for granted. I would do anything for you. You were jerky today and it bothered me. You seemed upset today, Im sorry. I wanted to speak with you, and not on the phone. I know you probably really want to see Maria and Kim and thats koo. It saddened me a little, but its koo. Im really angry inside, Im not sure but I think for the first time ever I don't want to see you. Im worried.
