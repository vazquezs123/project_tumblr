Some have claimed hooking up equates to making out. &nbsp;Others have referred to it as the action of coitus. &nbsp;Who knows. &nbsp;The only thing I do know is that, to some, it means a no strings attached, one night, hit it then quit, kind of ordeal. &nbsp;No one in college can/wants to be in a relationship, right? &nbsp;It is encumbering and stressful and they are simply too many other beautiful students that being tethered to one would be foolish. &nbsp;</p><p>It is this notion that are killing the romantics, those whom believe in passion over flirtation. &nbsp;Where did all my fellow romantics go by the way? &nbsp;I fear they are giving up on passion and/or turning to a life of flirtation. &nbsp;It is understandable how it can be easier to hide then be openly romantic. &nbsp;Why risk being called a fool and being told that you are wasting four great years by being in a relationship. &nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m hear to say all that is bullshit. &nbsp;Fuck what misguided people are saying. &nbsp;They may argue there are too many people to be with one. &nbsp;I argue they are so many people, find that one. &nbsp;If you love someone you hold on to them. &nbsp;</p><p>Others will put thoughts in your mind and doubts will arise, but it&rsquo;s important to take a step back and always analyse what is going on. &nbsp;See a counselor. &nbsp;Please see a counselor if you have any concerns and/or are having negative feelings. &nbsp;This is the first step to lessening the number of regrets in life. &nbsp;And to say&nbsp;&ldquo;live life without regrets&rdquo; is also bullshit. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s important to minimize those regrets, however. &nbsp;Minimize your doubts while you&rsquo;re at it. &nbsp;</p><p>To those romantics who&rsquo;ve found each other early on. &nbsp;Stay strong, because there is most likely a rough and bumpy road ahead of you. &nbsp;In addition to what I said earlier, if you love someone, you hold on to them until you can&rsquo;t anymore. &nbsp;Fight for what you have built. &nbsp;Love until you can&rsquo;t anymore. &nbsp;</p><p>And so to all my fellow college romantics, please stop hiding and please hear my typed words. &nbsp;In the words of Mitch Albom, &ldquo;accept who you are; and revel in it.&rdquo; &nbsp;I know I wish someone had given me this advice ahead of time. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="http://seniorscooba.tumblr.com/post/130898885907/to-the-college-romantic-please-do-not-give-up"><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">Oct 10, 2015</span><span class="post_notes"
